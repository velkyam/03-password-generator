# 03-password-generator

The goal of this project was to create a random password generating website. The website was built to improve the security of personal passwords to avoid using common words or easily accessible character patterns. The website can generate a random password based on the user's preferences of password length and types of characters. The way this project genrates random password is by: 
1. Generating random character type from the range of desired options selected by user (lower letters, specials, numbers, upper lettters)
2. Once random type of character is generated, it generates random index from the specific character type array.
3. Once completely random character is generated, it repeats this process the "password length" of times the user selects.
